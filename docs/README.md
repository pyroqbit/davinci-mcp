## 🎬 Quick Start

1. **Build the server**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run tests** (no DaVinci Resolve needed):
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. **Integrate with MCP clients** - The server implements the full MCP protocol
