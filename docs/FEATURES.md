## 🧪 Linux Testing Results

**Platform: Linux x86_64 (Arch 6.14.6)**

```bash
# Compilation test:
$ cargo check
✅ Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.69s
(Only minor warnings about unused fields)

# Build test:
$ cargo build --bin davinci-mcp-server
✅ Finished `dev` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s

# Runtime test:
$ echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | ./target/debug/davinci-mcp-server
✅ Server responds correctly: "Error: ExpectedInitializeRequest"
   (This is CORRECT behavior - MCP requires initialize first)
```
